# IA-project
This is our work for the IA course module project.  
We used a VGG16 based model for the computer vision part and streamlit for the interface.

To create a virtual env :
```

pipenv --python 3.8

```
To activate the Pipenv shell:
```

pipenv shell

```
To run the code :  
<ins>(after adding your model and own path for images)</ins>
```

pipenv install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run test.py

```

Hope it helped you
