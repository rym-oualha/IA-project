# IA-project
This is our work for the IA course module project.
We used a VGG16 based model for the computer vision part and streamlit for the interface.

to create a virtual env :
```

pipenv --python 3.8

```
to activate the Pipenv shell:
```

pipenv shell

```
to run the code :
(after adding your own path for images)
```

pipenv install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run test.py

```
